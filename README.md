# Your First iOS App Using UICukes

Apple provide a simple tutorial for introducing the tools, technologies and techniques (the three T's) of iOS app development. You can find the [tutorial online at the Apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/chapters/RM_YourFirstApp_iOS/Articles/00_Introduction.html) or as a [PDF](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/DOCUMENTATION/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhone101/iPhone101.pdf) (links work at the time of writing), also find it in Xcode developer documentation under iOS, General, Your First iOS App. Apple call it iOS __101__, a basic introduction. This guide aims to supplement Apple's 101 documentation by following the same tutorial but with Cucumber as our driver: a 101 exercise in behaviour-driven design.
